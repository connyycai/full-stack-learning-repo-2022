  "description": "This week, we continue our progress in frontend web development with React. React is a powerful and relatively lightweight framework used to rapidly build out HTML,CSS, and Javascript user interfaces. Although it is widely used, it often has a steep learning curve which is why we're dedicating the next two weeks to flesh out the topic.
